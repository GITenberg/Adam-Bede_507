description: 'Adam Bede is a hardy young carpenter who cares for his aging mother.
  His one weakness is the woman he loves blindly: the trifling town beauty, Hetty
  Sorrel, whose only delights are her baubles - and the delusion that the careless
  Captain Donnithorne may ask for her hand. Betrayed by their innocence, both Adam
  and Hetty allow their foolish hearts to trap them in a triangle of seduction, murder,
  and retribution. -Amazon.com.'
